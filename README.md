# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on a dataset from a telecom company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their service.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building (Random Forest)
4. Model Evaluation
5. Feature Importance Visualization

## Results
The model achieved [add accuracy here] accuracy on the test data. The most important features for predicting churn were [mention top features].

## How to Run
Clone the repository, install the necessary libraries, and run the Jupyter Notebook.
